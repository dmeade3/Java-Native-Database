Main use will be:
    a small lightweight database object in java





Datastore:

    Hash table of tables:
        -each table a file
            -header

    Database loader class:
        -reads in csv files from a directory
            -make in excel

    Database Script read / Execute class:
        -reads in text file as input
            -word by word
            -NFA style
                -use NFA class


Program to generate random databases for testing


Expression handling:

    -feed pattern like <exp> <and> <exp>
        -exp has regex and and has regex and looks for all on a loop
         and if all there it passed
            -while read in it is converted to a for usable to the boolean evaluater


    -boolean expression handling

    -numerical expression handling

    -combinations

Multithreading:
    -practice section

    -area to develop the multithreading for the database

    -http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_multithreading.htm

    -certain size default multi thread

    -can manual set multi thread option

    worker bee concept:
        -each thread has an index if where results are stored

        -thread given task then stores result in index

Config file:


Define database behavior:

    -read in database from file


Testing class:
    -time

    -operations per command

Expression evaluation:
    -Operations
        -Basic
            -Select
            -Project
            -Cartesian product
            -Union
            -Difference
            -Rename

        -Derived
            -Intersection
            -Join
            -Division

Misc.:

    -make large database to test with to make sure time is good

    -Make How to guide
